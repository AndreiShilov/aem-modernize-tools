---

The Modernization Tool Suite is an Open Source package that is designed to minimize the time spent modernizing AEM Sites content. 

By modernizing your AEM Sites codebase, you can take advantage of the latest features of the AEM product. The AEM Modernization tools will allow you to easily jump start their modernization effort starting with these 4 areas:
1.	Converting Static Templates and Column Control <span class="pointer">to</span> Editable Templates & Responsive Grid
1.	Designs & Design Dialogs <span class="pointer">to</span> Editable Template Policies
1.	Foundation Components <span class="pointer">to</span> Core Components
1.	Classic (ExtJS) Dialogs <span class="pointer">to</span> Coral Dialogs 


The AEM Modernization Tool suite is comprised of four distinct tools. Each is designed to help transform a specific part of your content from legacy implementations, to their modern counterparts.

These sections describe what each feature in the tool suite accomplishes. For information on how to configure the tools, see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration.html">configuration page.</a>
